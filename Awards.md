<p class="message">
  I've been lucky enough to win a few awards for my games. It's nothing to brag about and the only reason I've made this page is to add a bit of lustre to the lack-lustre website.

Few prizes I've won:

* Not Today - Winner of **best VR in Journalism** prize in HackReality 2021 conducted by University of North Carolina.
* Transit - Winner of **VR design challenge** conducted by University of Windsor.
* Wolfie - Declared as **Best Game in BotHacks** 2020.
* Pong Ultima - Winner of Apollo Hacks 2021.
